* Overview of Issue #2646 in Hy
Investigating [[https://github.com/hylang/hy/issues/2646][Hy GitHub Issue #2646]] regarding IPython REPL compatibility issues.

* Repository Structure
- hy-repo: Hy source code
- ipython-repo: IPython source code
- worktrees: Directory for git worktrees to test different configurations

* Research Areas
** Python's builtin.quit History and Usage
Tracking the implementation of builtin.quit in CPython and how it's handled in REPLs.

** REPL Support in Python, IPython, and Hy
Investigating how REPLs are implemented in:
- Python's built-in REPL
- IPython
- Hy

** Related CPython Issue
Information related to [[https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/119856][CPython Issue #119856]].

* Investigation Plan
1. Trace the execution flow in Hy's REPL when interacting with IPython
2. Identify how Python and IPython handle quit/exit in their REPLs
3. Compare implementation approaches
4. Test potential solutions using worktrees
