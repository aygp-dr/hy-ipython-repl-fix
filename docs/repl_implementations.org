* Python Standard REPL
Python's standard REPL is implemented in the ~code~ module, particularly ~code.InteractiveConsole~.

** Quit/Exit Implementation
- Python defines ~quit~ and ~exit~ as instances of ~_sitebuiltins._Quitter~
- These are injected by the ~site~ module during interpreter initialization
- Standard implementation is in ~Lib/site.py~
- The objects are added to ~builtins~ module

* IPython REPL
IPython reimplements the REPL with additional features.

** Quit/Exit Implementation
- IPython uses a ~BuiltinTrap~ class to manage Python builtins
- It removes the standard ~quit~ and ~exit~ functions from builtins
- Replaces them with its own ~ExitAutocall~ implementation
- Exposes these through the InteractiveShell's namespace
- When users call ~exit()~ or ~quit()~, they're invoking an ~ExitAutocall~ instance
- This allows IPython to perform proper cleanup before exiting

** Implementation Details
- ~IPython/core/builtin_trap.py~ - Manages the builtins
- Marked ~exit~ and ~quit~ as ~HideBuiltin~
- ~IPython/core/interactiveshell.py~ - Provides alternative implementations

* Hy REPL
Hy extends Python's standard REPL.

** Quit/Exit Implementation
- Hy's REPL is implemented in ~hy/repl.py~ as the ~REPL~ class
- Extends Python's ~code.InteractiveConsole~
- Creates custom objects for ~quit~, ~exit~, and ~help~ with ~HyQuitter~ and ~HyHelper~
- Stores the original builtins and replaces them with Hy-specific versions
- Restores the original values when the REPL exits

** The Issue
- Hy assumes ~builtins.quit~ and ~builtins.exit~ always exist
- In standard Python this is true, but not in IPython
- IPython removes these from builtins
- Attempting to access ~builtins.quit~ raises an AttributeError

* Potential Solutions
1. Use ~getattr(builtins, "quit", fallback)~ instead of direct access
2. Create dummy functions when the attributes don't exist
3. Properly handle cases where the builtins are missing
