* Overview

This repository investigates and fixes an issue with Hy's REPL when used within IPython, as reported in [[https://github.com/hylang/hy/issues/2646][Hy GitHub Issue #2646]].

The issue occurs when attempting to launch the Hy REPL from within IPython, resulting in an ~AttributeError: module 'builtins' has no attribute 'quit'~ error.

* Getting Started

** Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- IPython
- Hy
- Emacs with Org mode (for working with tutorials)

** Installation

#+begin_src bash
# Clone the repository with submodules
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/aygp-dr/hy-ipython-repl-fix.git
cd hy-ipython-repl-fix

# Set up a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
#+end_src

* Development Workflow

This repository uses git worktrees to organize different aspects of the investigation and solution:

#+begin_src bash
# Create and checkout a worktree for issue reproduction
git worktree add --detach worktrees/reproduce-issue
cd worktrees/reproduce-issue
git checkout -b reproduce-issue

# Create and checkout a worktree for the fix implementation
git worktree add --detach worktrees/fix-implementation
cd worktrees/fix-implementation
git checkout -b fix-implementation

# Create and checkout a worktree for the monkey patch
git worktree add --detach worktrees/monkey-patch
cd worktrees/monkey-patch
git checkout -b monkey-patch
#+end_src
